    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tbs virgin coconut oil or extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>1 14 oz package firm or extra-firm tofu, patted dry, cut into 1/2" cubes</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 medium onions, coarsely chopped</li>
        <li>3 large zucchini, cut into 1/2" pieces</li>
        <li>8 oz green beans, trimmed, cut into 1" pieces</li>
        <li>1 13.5 oz can unsweetened coconut milk</li>
        <li>Lime wedges, cilantro leaves with tender stems, and coarsely chopped salted, roasted peanuts (for serving)</li>
        <li>2 cups cooked rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large skillet, preferably nonstick, over medium-high. Add tofu in a single layer and cook, turning over once, until cooked sides are golden brown, about 4 minutes. Transfer to paper towels to drain. Season with kosher salt.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. oil in a large pot or high-sided skillet over medium-high. Add onions and a generous pinch of salt and stir to coat. Cook, stirring often, until softened, about 4 minutes. Stir in curry paste and cook, stirring often, until darkened in color, about 2 minutes. Add zucchini, eggplant, and green beans and cook, tossing to coat, until vegetables are softened and starting to brown in spots, 5-7 minutes. Pour in coconut milk and Â½ cup water and bring to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Add tofu to pot and stir gently to combine. Cook until warmed through, about 3 minutes. Season with more salt if needed.</li>
        <li>Divide curry among bowls and add a generous squeeze of lime juice to each. Top with cilantro and peanuts.
